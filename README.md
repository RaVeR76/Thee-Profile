***HERO IMAGE OR WEBSITE DISPLAY IMAGE***
 

## **Project Goals**

To let the world know who I am .... and what I can do !  
I'm going to create a personal website that will display my skills so far, which isn't much unfortunately ha ha, but like I always say ... *it's a grower* :)
What I mean is, the more experience I gain then the more my wee developer portfolio will **grow** and tut tut if that wasn't your first thought. 
I honestly love coding and you learn something everyday from it that simply blows your mind. 
I'm going to **try** keep it relatively simple, notice the emphasis on *try*, because I love a bit of creativity and flare to be honest.
I just want the user to feel they know me bit better and know that I give 100% in everything I do (as I do the Hulk clench as show of strength)
And I do it with a smile :)

**Remember ..... Hug Harder, Laugh Louder, Smile Bigger & Love Longer !**

### **User Requirements and Expectations**

#### Requirements 

* Single page portfolio design
* Ease of navigation
* An aesthetically pleasing website
* Easy to perform CRUD operations (Admin)
* Contact form
* Admin access for various functions
* A little uniqueness to hopefully stand out a little bit more


#### Expectations

* To enjoy the website layout and navigate freely with no issues
* To know a little bit more about the developer
* 
*


### **Design Choices**

I will be using Bootstrap 4 to create the overall layout of my website, as this will make it easier for me to control it's functionality across multiple devices.
I just want it to be a simple and easy on the eye .... nothing too adventurous or loud !
It will be a one page scrolling website split into various sections, each displaying certain information about the developer.



#### Fonts

For my fonts, I am going to use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) as my source of inspiration :)
I have settled on the simplicity side of things & the more user friendly style of [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway)
for the main text and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) for titles and section headings.

Below is an example of my fonts where the title is in ***Roboto*** and the text is in ***Raleway*** .....

#### Icons

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) will be the main source for any icons that I require. 
I will deffo be using the various programming language icons and some social media icons on my website.
Other than them, we will just have to see what suits and fits the web page layout perfectly.


#### Colours

I love happy, bright, vibriant colours to be honest as I am an ex-raver and generally a chilled out happy go lucky person 
(I had to use the term *generally* because of JavaScript ha ha .... deffo lost a few hairs over that one).
Anyway, I don't want to make this website too loud and off putting but I want the colours to have like a chilled out vibriant feel, if you get what I mean.
Basically not too bright but not to dull either .... still confused, yeah me too ! I think AMBIENT is the keyword I'm looking for here :)  

So the colours I have mainly settled for are :

|Name                  |Hex Code   |Basic Description  |Usage                           |
|:--------------------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:------------------------------:|
|***Cultured***        |#F5F5F5    |Off White          |Body background, text & titles  |
|***Blizzard Blue***   |#A1EAF7    |Light Sky Blue     |Body background                 |
|***Fuzzy Wuzzy***     |#E36464    |Bubblegum Pink     |Body background                 |
|***Smoky Black***     |#110303    |Off Black          |Body background, text & titles  |

Below is an image of the chosen colours .....
