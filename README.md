## **Project Goals**

To let the world know who I am .... and what I can do !  
I'm going to create a personal website that will display my skills so far, which isn't much unfortunately ha ha, but like I always say ... *it's a grower* :)
What I mean is, the more experience I gain then the more my wee developer portfolio will **grow** and tut tut if that wasn't your first thought. 
I honestly love coding and you learn something everyday from it that simply blows your mind. 
I'm going to **try** keep it relatively simple, notice the emphasis on *try*, because I love a bit of creativity and flare to be honest.
I just want the user to feel they know me bit better and know that I give 100% in everything I do (as I do the Hulk clench as show of strength)
And I do it with a smile :)

**Remember ..... Hug Harder, Laugh Louder, Smile Bigger & Love Longer !**
